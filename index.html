                after the day of the week <br>they were born and the order 
                in which they were born. These "day names" have further meanings <br>
                concerning the soul and character of the person. Middle names 
                have considerably more variety and <br>can refer to their birth order, 
                twin status, or an ancestor's middle name.<br><br><br><br><br>
